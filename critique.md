#Critique at 18F

Critique is a tool that we can use to improve the effectiveness and impact of our designs. It is a collaborative
effort by which we can begin to assess how well a design is serving user needs and meeting business goals.

The ultimate goal of critique is to identify for the designer what is working well in their design and what could be
improved. We can achieve this by following some practices that help ensure we're in a good place to provide valuable
critique:

## For the designer asking for critique

* Tell the group which parts of your design you're asking to have critiqued. This helps focus the conversation on the
parts you're working on now, and avoids tangents about parts you haven't worked on yet and parts that are already
settled. Be specific about your request, and don't be afraid to focus on a narrow piece of the design.
* Send a pre-read to the group with the following items:
  1. A description of what we're critiquing
  2. A short summary of user research (1 page or less)
  3. The user needs/goals the design is trying to meet
  4. The business goals the design is trying to meet
  5. Comps or prototypes
* Try not to defend your design; this is just a collection of feedback from fresh eyes. You're free to include or not
include the critique as you see fit.

## For those providing critique

* Keep in mind this mental framework to help yourself provide critique:
  1. What was the creator trying to achieve?
  2. How did they try to achieve it?
  3. How effective were their choices?
  4. Why is or isn't what they did effective?
* Remember that you are critiquing the design, not the designer.
* Be sure to identify both parts of the design that are meeting the goals well and parts that could be better.
* Limit your critique to the parts the designer is asking for critique about. Other parts of the design may not have
been worked on yet, or may have constraints and goals that you don't know about.
* Avoid problem solving or brainstorming unless the designer asks for it. Your job is to provide feedback about what
is working and what isn't -- the designer will take that back and iterate on their work.
* Feel free to ask questions if you don't understand what the designer is trying to do or if you don't understand
what the motivation for something was.

## For everybody
It may take some time to get into a good rhythm as a team around critique. But if we're disciplined and stick with
it, we'll build the basline knowledge of each other's projects, users, and habits. Over time, this will feel like
second nature.

A few more general guildlines that should help:

* Use Hangouts for remote critique. Other video chat/screenshare solutions we've tried have poor video (and audio)
fidelity, making it difficult to see and hear.
* Timebox critique to 15 or 20 minutes: 5 minutes to explain the topic of critique and goals of the design, and the
remainder of the time for the critique itself.
* Have a team-wide critique session every week. With an hour of time, we can critique three different projects.
* Have critiques without the entire team. Work with other people on your project, or just other designers who are
available when you need the critique.
