#Critique at 18F

Critique is a tool that we can use to improve the effectiveness and impact of our designs. It is a collaborative
effort by which we can begin to assess how well a design is serving user needs and meeting business goals.

The ultimate goal of critique is to identify for the designer what is working well in their design and what could be
improved. We can achieve this by following some practices that help ensure we're in a good place to provide valuable
critique:

## For the designer asking for critique

* Tell the group which parts of your design you're asking to have critiqued. This helps focus the conversation on the
parts you're working on now, and avoids tangents about parts you haven't worked on yet and parts that are already
settled. Be specific about your request, and don't be afraid to focus on a narrow piece of the design.
* Send a pre-read to the group with the following items:
  1. A description of what we're critiquing
  2. A short summary of user research (1 page or less)
  3. The user needs/goals the design is trying to meet
  4. The business goals the design is trying to meet
  5. Comps or prototypes
* Try not to defend your design; this is just a collection of feedback from fresh eyes. You're free to include or not
include the critique as you see fit.
* Use Hangouts for remote critique. Other video chat/screenshare solutions we've tried have poor video (and audio)
fidelity, making it difficult to see and hear.

## For those providing critique

* Keep in mind this mental framework to help yourself provide critique:
  1. What was the creator trying to achieve?
  2. How did they try to achieve it?
  3. How effective were their choices?
  4. Why is or isn't what they did effective?
* Be sure to identify both parts of the design that are meeting the goals well and parts that could be better.
