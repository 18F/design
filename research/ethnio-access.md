## Template questions for new account holders
- What project do you want to use ethnio for?
- Where do you plan to put the screener? (Links are helpful!)
- How long is the project or the time you plan to need access to ethnio?
- Do you anticipate any high traffic time/event that we should keep an eye on? _(We're asking this question because we pay for ethnio by page view, so one project could effect other projects ability to use the tool.)_
- Do you plan to use ethnio in a tweet or blog post?
